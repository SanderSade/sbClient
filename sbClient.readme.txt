No lengthy readme. 
If you need any help, go to http://www.dukelupus.com/sbclient - a sbClient homepage with all the help on it. 

As a last resort, send an e-mail to dukelupus@gmail.com - but beware, this is not my main account and I don't check it often. 
Please also give your version of sbClient, mIRC and Windows.

Thx. DukeLupus
