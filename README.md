sbClient is a [SearchBot](http://dukelupus.com/searchbot) client for mIRC.

sbClient automatically opens downloaded search results; you can use sbClient to make very fast local searches in downloaded lists and it can group @find/@locator results. 

sbClient is capable of automatically requesting SearchBot triggers from channel and can combine results from different search types.
